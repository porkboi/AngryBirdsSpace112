1. A short description of the project's name and what it does. 

The project is a recreation of the classic iPhone game "Angry Birds". It features 2 different gravity conditions - 1 on Earth and 1 in Space - and recreates physics largely accurately.

2. How to run the project. 

In the editor, one should save all files to the main directory and run main.py. Since source files such as images use relative paths, so long as the relative directory remains the same as the zip file, the program should run.

3. Which libraries you're using that need to be installed, if any. If you can include the library in the submission, that is preferred.

No libraries need to be installed.

4. A list of any shortcut commands that exist. Shortcut commands can be used to demonstrate specific features by skipping forward in a game or loading sample data. They're useful for when you're testing your code too!

There is only 1 shortcut command - to view the full trajectory of the space bird. In parabolaPlot.py Line 116, if not hit can be changed to if not hit or hit.

5. Which fonts you're using that need to be installed, if any. These fonts should be listed by their specific name. This includes any custom fonts or fonts that may not be downloaded on users' files. If you can include the installation file (.ttf or .otf) in the submission, that is preferred.
